# isitsafe

Just a script using Curl to pull some information about a website to see if it's legit or not. I just got tired of running multiple commands, so I put them all in one and made this script. Useful for me, not sure if it will be useful to anyone else. Or maybe it will? Who knows.

Enjoy and if you see something that you don't think is right, let me know and I will get to it when I can!

Usage:

./isitsafe.sh https://www.example.com

Thanks for checking it out!
